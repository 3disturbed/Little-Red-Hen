Project Title
I wanted to produce a simple HTML, CSS and Javascript programme for teachers to use in the classroom to make the story of The Little Red Hen more interactive when reading it within the classroom. 

Description
The Little Red Hen is a story used in reception that teaches children the importance of hard work and the consequences of laziness. I was inspired to produce this project primarily to practice my skills that I have already learnt and also as my daughter is currently working in reception and was looking for extra resources for her students. 
It will consist of website pages similar to the layout of the book and each page will include the hen asking for help and the cat, duck and dog refusing to help her. The interactivity comes from when you click on each of the animals it will produce a pop up speech bubble with the text within. I am hoping this will encourage some students to be able to see words and how they look when spoken. Whilst hearing stories is important I feel there should be a visual indication of what spellings are used and how they work in written languages.
